# Altium MCP Server

TLDR: Use Claude to control or ask questions about your Altium project.
This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides an interface to interact with Altium Designer through Python. The server allows for querying and manipulation of PCB designs programmatically.

## Example commands
- Run all output jobs
- Create a symbol for the part in the attached datasheet and use the currently open symbol as a reference example.
- Create a schematic symbol from the attached MPM3650 switching regulator datasheet and make sure to strictly follow the symbol placement rules. (Note: Need to open a schematic library. Uses `AppData\Roaming\Claude\Claude Extensions\local.dxt.altium-mcp\server\symbol_placement_rules.txt` description as pin placement rules. Please modify for your own preferences.)
- Create an op-amp symbol with a triangle body like the other op-amps in my library (symbols support line/polygon/arc/ellipse/label body graphics, not just rectangles)
- Find me the LM358 symbol in my opamp library and open it
- Create a multi-part symbol for a quad op-amp from the attached LM324 datasheet (creates parts A, B, C, D with shared V+/V- power pins)
- Create a PCB footprint for the SMD part in the attached datasheet and add it to my open PcbLib
- Duplicate my selected layout. (Will prompt user to now select destination components. Supports Component, Track, Arc, Via, Polygon, & Region)
- Show all my inner layers. Show the top and bottom layer. Turn off solder paste.
- Get me all parts on my design made by Molex
- Give me the description and part number of U4
- Place the selected parts on my pcb with best practices for a switching regulator, then verify clearances and show me a screenshot of the result
- Give me a list of all IC designators in my design
- Get me all length matching rules

## Installing the MCP Server
The easiest way to install is to use Claude Code, point it to this repo and ask it to install it for you. Or alternatively, see below.

[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/HKQMK-hluLs)

1. Make sure Claude has Python 3.10+ installed: `drop down > File > Settings > Extensions > Advanced > Python`. If not, install Python and add it to PATH.
2. Download the `altium-mcp.dxt` desktop extension file from [releases](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/releases)
3. In Claude Desktop on Windows: `drop down > File > Settings > Extensions > Advanced > Install Extension...` Select the .dxt file

You shouldn't need to restart Claude and you should now see altium-mcp in the tool menu near the search bar.

## Creating a new .dxt (For Developers)

### Bootstrap Venv (Recommended)

This approach ships a small bootstrap script (`start_server.py`) that creates a virtual environment and pip-installs dependencies on the user's machine at first launch. The .dxt is tiny (~60 KB) and works across any Python 3.10+ version.

The older approach of bundling pre-compiled packages in `server/lib/` is no longer recommended — it breaks when the user's Python version doesn't match the version used to build the bundled `.pyd` files (e.g. pydantic_core compiled for 3.11 fails on 3.13).

**How it works:**

1. `start_server.py` (at the repo root) looks for a ready virtual environment in `%USERPROFILE%\.altium-mcpenvs\<key>`, where `<key>` is a hash of the pinned requirements and the Python version
2. If it isn't ready, it starts a **detached** builder process (`start_server.py --build`) that creates the venv and pip-installs the pinned dependencies, then waits for it. Claude Desktop kills a server that has not answered within about 60 seconds, and restarts servers freely; a build that ran inside the launcher died with it. The detached builder finishes regardless, so a restarted launcher finds the venv ready or a build still in progress.
3. A lock file (holding the builder's PID) makes sure only one build runs at a time; other launchers wait for it. A lock whose owner has exited is taken over immediately.
4. It then launches `server/main.py` using the venv's Python
5. First launch takes ~20-30 seconds; subsequent launches are instant

The venv, `config.json` and `build.log` live in `%USERPROFILE%\.altium-mcp`, not in the extension folder, because Claude Desktop replaces the extension folder on every update. The slow build therefore happens once per machine (and again only when the requirements or Python version change), and a hand-picked Altium path survives updates. AppData is deliberately avoided: Claude Desktop is an MSIX package, and writes its child processes make under AppData are redirected into `...\Packages\Claude_...\LocalCache`, so a venv built from a terminal and one built by the server would end up in different places. Set the `ALTIUM_MCP_HOME` environment variable to use a different folder. A `config.json` left beside `server/main.py` by an older version is migrated automatically on first start.

On a slow network the first build can exceed the client's 60-second startup timeout. The build carries on in the background, so restarting the extension once it has finished is enough; `build.log` shows progress.

**Build steps:**

1. Make sure `start_server.py` exists at the repo root (see below for contents)
2. Make sure `server/main.py` does NOT have the old `site.addsitedir` hack at the top
3. Update `manifest.json`: set `entry_point` to `start_server.py`, remove any `env`/`PYTHONPATH` fields, and use `manifest_version: "0.3"`
4. Package the DXT — either use `dxt pack` or manually zip and rename:
```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path manifest.json, start_server.py, pyproject.toml, server -DestinationPath altium-mcp.zip
Rename-Item altium-mcp.zip altium-mcp.dxt
```

**Do NOT include `server/lib/` or `server/.venv/` in the .dxt.** The whole point is that these are created on the user's machine.

**`start_server.py`:** use the file at the repo root as is. It is no longer reproduced here, so the two cannot drift apart.

**`manifest.json` server section:**
```json
"server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "start_server.py",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["${__dirname}/start_server.py"]
    }
  }
```

### Pitfalls

These are hard-won lessons from debugging DXT builds. Violating any of these will produce errors that are difficult to diagnose.

1. **Do NOT use `os.execv()` in `start_server.py`.** The DXT installs to a path containing spaces (`Claude Extensions`). On Windows, `os.execv` splits the path at the space and fails. Use `sys.exit(subprocess.call([...]))` instead.

2. **Pin `mcp` to `==1.5.0`.** Using `>=1.5.0` pulls in the latest version, which has breaking API changes (`FastMCP.__init__()` dropped the `description` kwarg). The server code was written against 1.5.0.

3. **Do NOT use `manifest_version: "0.4"` with `"type": "uv"`.** Claude Desktop does not support it yet. You will get `Invalid manifest: server: Required`. Use `"type": "python"` with `manifest_version: "0.3"`.

4. **After removing the `site.addsitedir` hack from `main.py`, fix the `pathlib.Path` reference.** The hack included `import pathlib` at the top of the file. The logging setup later uses `pathlib.Path(...)` which will throw `NameError` once that import is gone. Change it to `Path(...)` — the `from pathlib import Path` import already exists in the file, just make sure it comes before the logging setup.

5. **Do NOT bundle `server/lib/` in the DXT.** That was the old approach and defeats the purpose of the venv bootstrap.

### Legacy: Bundled server/lib (Not Recommended)

This approach bundles all dependencies in `server/lib/` and sets `PYTHONPATH` to point to it. It produces a much larger .dxt (~17 MB) and **only works if the user's Python version matches the version used to compile the bundled packages**.

1. Populate packages: `python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --target server/lib -r requirements.txt`
2. Set the manifest `entry_point` to `server/main.py` and add `"env": {"PYTHONPATH": "${__dirname}/server/lib"}` to `mcp_config`
3. Package: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/dxt && dxt pack`

## Configuration

When launching claude for the first time, the server will automatically try to locate your Altium Designer installation. It will search for all directories that start with `C:\Program Files\Altium\AD*` and use the one with the largest revision number. If it cannot find any, you will be prompted to select the Altium executable (X2.EXE) manually when you first run the server. Altium's DelphiScript scripting is used to create an API between the mcp server and Altium. 

## Available Tools

The server provides several tools to interact with Altium Designer:

### Output Jobs
- `get_output_job_containers`: Reads all available output containers of an .OutJob file - the one named by `outjob_path`, or the first OutJob of any open project when the path is omitted.
- `run_output_jobs`: Pass a list of output job container names to run any number of them; `outjob_path` names the .OutJob (it is opened and focused as needed), otherwise the first OutJob of any open project is used.

### PCB STEP Export
- `export_pcb_step`: Export one explicit `.PcbDoc` of a `.PrjPcb` with an exact assembly variant name (`[No Variations]` for the base design). It creates an isolated export project that owns a dedicated, single-generator OutJob, includes all components and holes, and keeps component bodies separate. The export project preserves the source project settings and variant definitions, rebases its document references to absolute paths, and adds only the dedicated OutJob. `include_extruded_bodies=false` (default) selects Altium's AsStep model option. Set it to `true` to request AsBoth (STEP and extruded bodies); overlapping representations may then be present.
- Give absolute **local-drive** paths for the project, PCB, and new `.step`/`.stp` file. The output directory must exist; existing output files are never overwritten. Use a local working copy when Altium cannot reliably open a network/WSL source path.
- Unsaved source documents are refused; the tool does not save the project, PCB, or existing OutJobs. It checks the project/PCB/variant in Altium, runs the job, then requires exactly one fresh, complete STEP file and unchanged source hashes before publishing the requested file. This checks the export artifact, not geometric completeness or component collisions; inspect the STEP in your mechanical CAD system.
- The unique `altium-step-*` directory is retained with the generated project, OutJob and original export for diagnostics. Export-command errors, timeouts, missing/truncated/stale files, and ambiguous multiple files return `success=false`; a bridge dispatch alone is not treated as export success. Do not retry while Altium is still finishing a timed-out run.
- The ExportSTEPView configuration and variant handling are based on Altium's serialized OutJob format and API. Loading a generated job and reading back its explicit source and variant were verified in Altium Designer 26.9.1. Offline tests cover selection, validation, source preservation, output races and export failures; live STEP generation still requires validation in the target Altium installation.

Offline tests (do not start Altium):
```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s server/tests -p test_step_export.py -v
```

### Component Information
- `get_all_designators`: Get a list of all component designators in the current board
- `get_all_component_property_names`: Get a list of all available component property names
- `get_component_property_values`: Get the values of a specific property for all components
- `get_component_data`: Get detailed data for specific components by designator
- `get_component_pins`: Get pin information for specified components

### Schematic/Symbol
- `get_schematic_data`: Get schematic data for specified components
- `create_schematic_symbol` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/MMP7ZfmbCMI)): Passes pin list with pin type & coordinates to Altium script. Supports multi-part symbols (e.g. quad op-amps) via a `part_count` parameter and an `owner_part_id` field on each pin (use 0 for shared power/GND pins), active-low pin name overbars by placing a backslash after each overbarred character (e.g. `R\E\S\E\T\` renders as `RESET` with overbar), per-pin length and name/designator visibility, and an optional `graphics` list (lines, polylines, polygons, rectangles, arcs, ellipses, labels) for non-rectangular bodies like op-amp triangles and diode glyphs. When creating a symbol, the agent is instructed to first look up a similar symbol in an available library as a style reference (skipped gracefully if no library is available).
- `get_symbol_primitives`: Inventory a .SchLib (every symbol with per-type primitive counts) or dump one symbol's complete geometry (all graphics + pin details, in mils; `symbol_name="*"` dumps every symbol). Used to gap-analyze a library, to give the agent a reference example when drawing a new symbol, and to verify recreations. The symbol creator round-trips a complete production library set exactly - 514/514 symbols across IC, connector, misc, and passives libraries (dump -> recreate -> dump -> diff, zero differences). Footprint/model links (implementations) are metadata outside the graphics round-trip.
- `create_symbols_batch`: Create many symbols in one script run from a plain-text spec file (bulk imports/migrations) - far faster and more robust than one create call per symbol.
- `get_symbol_placement_rules`: Create symbol's helper tool that reads `~\AppData\Roaming\Claude\Claude Extensions\local.dxt.altium-mcp\server\symbol_placement_rules.txt` to get pin placement rules for symbol creation.
- `get_library_symbol_reference`: Create symbol's helper tool to use an open library symbol as an example to create the symbol
- `search_library_symbol`: Search for a symbol by name in a schematic library (.SchLib) and navigate to it. Supports partial name matching. Will open the library file in Altium if a path is provided, or show a file picker if not.

### Schematic Sheets (editing existing sheets)
- `get_schematic_sheet`: Read every object of a sheet - components with parameters, footprint models and pin connection points, labels, net labels, ports, sheet symbols with entries, wires, junctions, No-ERC and power ports - in mils. The survey step before any edit.
- `place_schematic_components`: Place symbols from a `.SchLib` onto an existing sheet (designator, position, orientation, mirror, comment, footprint model, parameters) and get back the measured connection point of every placed pin. A symbol whose pins do not survive Altium's `Replicate` is rebuilt from its primitives.
- `add_schematic_wiring`: Wires, junctions, net labels, power ports, sheet ports, No-ERC markers and notes on an existing sheet.
- `edit_schematic_text`: Replace, move, delete or add free text; rename sheet symbols.
- `set_component_parameters`: Parameters (assembly variants such as `Assembly_Base`), comment and footprint model of placed components.
- `delete_schematic_objects`: Components by designator, other objects by position.
- `edit_schematic_sheet`: The batch form of the tools above - one pipe-delimited spec applied to several sheets in a single Altium run (same record format as `build_schematic`, plus the editing records). Every touched sheet is saved.
- `create_schematic_project`: Create a `.PrjPcb` (when missing) with new, sized, empty sheets saved under the given paths and added to the project.
- `add_sheet_symbols`: Place hierarchical sheet symbols with their sheet entries (plus wires, net labels, notes and frame lines) on a sheet - the active block diagram of a project.
- `compile_project`: Compile a `.PrjPcb`, return Altium's violations (ERC) and, on request, the net of every pin - the proof that an edit connected what it should.
- `open_project`: Open a project of any kind (`.PrjPcb`, `.PrjMbd`, ...) and list its logical documents - the check for a project a tool wrote.
- `save_documents`: Save open documents by path, including libraries left unsaved by the creation tools.

### Multi-board Design
- `create_multiboard_project`: Write a Multi-board Design project (`.PrjMbd`) with a Multi-board Schematic (`.MbsDoc`) whose modules reference child PCB projects; the files are written directly, as that editor has no scripting interface; `link_multiboard_modules` then imports the connectors and connects them.
- `link_multiboard_modules`: Import the connectors of the child projects into a Multi-board Schematic as module entries and connect them pin by pin, as Design » Import From Child Projects and Place » Direct Connection do. The child projects are opened and only read; a later run refreshes the nets and designators of connectors already imported and reports what it does not rebuild.
- `run_multiboard_erc`: Reload a Multi-board Schematic, run its ERC and return the Messages panel; a schematic with unsaved changes is refused.
- `create_project_group`: Write a project group (`.DsnWrk`) listing the projects Altium opens together.
- `open_project_group`: Open a project group in a freshly started Altium; refused while documents have unsaved changes or a saved group in the workspace has changed.

### Layout Operations
- `get_all_nets`: Returns a list of unique nets from the pcb
- `create_net_class` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/89booqRbnzQ)): Create a net class from a list of nets
- `get_pcb_layers`: Get detailed layer information including electrical, mechanical, layer pairs, etc.
- `get_pcb_layer_stackup`: Gets stackup info like dielectric, layer thickness, etc.
- `set_pcb_layer_visibility` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/XaWs5A6-h30)): Turn on or off any group of layers. For example turn on inner layers. Turn off silk.
- `get_pcb_rules`: Gets the rule descriptions for all pcb rules in layout.
- `get_selected_components_coordinates`: Get position, rotation, layer, and footprint information for currently selected components
- `move_components`: Move specified components by X and Y offsets
- `set_component_position`: Set one component's absolute position and rotation
- `place_components`: Batch absolute placement - place any number of components (x, y, rotation, top/bottom layer) in a single transaction / one undo step. The workhorse for AI-driven placement.
- `check_placement`: Verify a placement - finds overlaps and clearance violations against every other component on the board using true primitive-to-primitive distances (designator text excluded). Run after placing; a screenshot is not verification.
- `check_orientation`: Advisory check for 2-pad passives whose rotation could be improved (e.g. a decoupling cap with its GND pad facing away from the IC). Geometry only - review suggestions with judgement; parts like pull-ups don't care.
- `get_net_connections`: For the nets touching a set of components, list every pad on each net board-wide with per-net airline (MST) lengths - the data behind connectivity-driven placement (shorten critical nets, see off-cluster loads and filter banks).
- `layout_duplicator` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/HD-A_8iVV70)): Starts layout duplication assuming you have already selected the source components on the PCB.
- `layout_duplicator_apply`: Action #2 of `layout_duplicator`. Agent will use part info automatically to predict the match between source and destination components, then will send those matches to the place script.

The cool thing about layout duplication this way as opposed to with Altium's built in layout replication, is that the exact components don't have to match because the LLM can look through the descriptions and understand which components match and which don't have a match. That's something that can't really be hard coded.

### PCB Footprint Library
- `create_pcb_footprint`: Create a new PCB footprint in the currently active .PcbLib document. Supports SMD pads (Rect, Round, Oval shapes) defined in mm relative to the component origin. Auto-generates a courtyard on Mech 15 and silkscreen with a pin 1 indicator (gap in the top-left corner), or accepts explicit courtyard dimensions. Contributed by [coffeedust](https://github.com/coffeedust) ([PR #7](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/7)).
- `get_footprint_primitives`: Inventory a .PcbLib (per-footprint primitive counts) or dump complete footprint geometry - pads with full stack/hole detail, tracks, arcs, fills, texts, regions - in mils. The reference source when recreating or verifying footprints. 3D bodies are excluded as models.
- `create_footprints_batch`: Create many footprints in one script run from a plain-text spec file: SMD + through-hole pads (holes, slots, plating, rotation, full pad stack), tracks, arcs, fills, texts, and regions on any layer. Round-trip verified against complete production SMD and through-hole libraries.

### Both
- `get_screenshot`: Take a screenshot of the Altium PCB window or Schematic Window that is the current view, returned as a proper image the agent can see. For PCB views, an optional `zoom_to` list of designators makes Altium zoom to those components before capture so they fill the frame. It should auto focus either document type if it is open but a different document type is focused.

### Scripting / Development
- `run_altium_script`: Run a DelphiScript snippet in an **isolated sandbox script project** and get back a step-by-step log, the script's result, and - when a script dies - the exact statement that killed it. Altium has no headless test mode: a runtime error leaves the script paused in the debugger with no dialog, after which every later run silently does nothing until the debugger is stopped (Ctrl+F3) or Altium restarts. This tool detects that state and reports it. Because the sandbox is a separate script project, a crash can never break the other MCP tools. Useful for developing and verifying new Altium API code before building a tool around it. An optional `declarations` argument takes unit-level DelphiScript (const/var blocks, procedures, functions) that the body can call, so a larger script keeps its own helpers instead of being flattened into statements; `declarations_file` points at a `.pas` file with the same content when it is generated or too large to pass inline.
- `recover_script_executor`: After a script run reports `executor_wedged`, dispatch Altium's Stop Debugging process into the running instance (`X2.EXE -REditScript:Stop`, no window focus needed) and prove recovery with a one-line sandbox probe. Ctrl+F3 by hand remains the fallback.
- `ensure_altium_script_skill`: Check whether the [altium-script skill](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-scripts-skill) (Altium DelphiScript API reference, examples, and conventions) is installed, and install it on request. Skills load at client startup, so a newly installed skill appears after a restart.

### Server Status
- `get_server_status`: Check the status of the MCP server, including paths to Altium and script files

## How It Works

The server communicates with Altium Designer using a scripting bridge:

1. It writes command requests to `workspace\request.json`
2. It launches Altium with instructions to run the `Altium_API.PrjScr` script
3. The script processes the request and writes results to `workspace\response.json`
4. The server reads and returns the response
